## Description
A mod for Crosscode adding a palicat pet, inspired by the palicos from Monster Hunter

## Installation
First and formost, **be sure to have a backup on any save files that is important to you BEFORE testing the mod**, a wrong installation could corrupt your save file.
For this mod to work you will need to install:  
the CCLoader mod  
	download link : https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader

the item-api mod  
	download link : https://github.com/CCDirectLink/item-api

the templating-api mod (item-api needs it to work)  
	download link : https://github.com/CCDirectLink/templating-api

Once all mods are installed, you can : 
1. Download the repository by left clicking on the Clone or download and left click on Download Zip.
2. Unzip the zip file.
3. Copy the "palicat-master" folder into your CrossCode "assets\mods" folder (provided by CCLoader in the crosscode directory  
	the path should be something like this : "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\CrossCode\assets\mods")

## How does it work ?
Once the mod is installed and active, a palicat pet should be added automaticly to your inventory.

You can check if the mod is active in the game's option, in the "mod" tab (provided by CCLoader).
