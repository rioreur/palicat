# palicat
## Description
A mod for Crosscode adding a palicat pet, inspired by the palicos from Monster Hunter

## InstalLation
First and formost, **be sure to have a backup on any save files that is important to you BEFORE testing the mod**, a wrong installation could corrupt your save file.
For this mod to work you will need to install:  
the CCLoader mod  
	download link : https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader

the item-api mod  
	download link : https://github.com/CCDirectLink/item-api
	
the templating-api mod (item-api needs it to work)
	download link : https://github.com/CCDirectLink/templating-api

Once both mods are installed, you can : 
1. Download the repository by left clicking on the Clone or download and left click on Download Zip.
2. Unzip the zip file.
3. Copy the "palicat-master" folder into your CrossCode "assets\mods" folder (provided by CCLoader in the crosscode directory  
	the path should be something like this : "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\CrossCode\assets\mods")

## How does it work ?
Once the mod is installed and active, a palicat pet should be added automaticly to your inventory.

You can check if the mod is active in the game's option, in the "mod" tab (provided by CCLoader).
If the mod is not selected , select it and restart your game to activate it. You can disable it by repeating the same steps.

If you have any problem, try updating your CCLoader mod and item-api mod.
